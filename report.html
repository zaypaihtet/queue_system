<p>This project addresses the critical challenge of restaurant queue management by developing a modern, AI-assisted platform that streamlines the entire process from customer registration to seating. The system automates queue number generation, provides real-time status updates, predicts accurate wait times using artificial intelligence, and delivers comprehensive analytics for operational insights.</p>

<p>The Restaurant Queue Management System is designed to handle both dine-in (Table) and takeaway (Kitchen) queues simultaneously, allowing restaurant staff to manage different customer types efficiently. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies including Flask web framework, JavaScript for dynamic user interactions, SQLite database for data persistence, and OpenAI's GPT-5 model for intelligent wait time predictions.</p>

<p>Key features of the system include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Complete Customer Lifecycle Management:</strong> Full CRUD operations for adding, viewing, updating, and removing customers from the queue</li>
    <li><strong>AI-Powered Wait Time Prediction:</strong> Machine learning algorithms analyze current queue data, party sizes, time of day, and historical patterns to provide accurate wait time estimates</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Live queue status updates ensuring staff always have current information</li>
    <li><strong>Search and Filter Capabilities:</strong> Quick customer lookup by name or phone number, with filtering by queue type</li>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<!-- 2. BACKGROUND -->
<h1>2. Background</h1>

<h2>2.1 Problem Domain (Background of the Problem)</h2>

<p>The restaurant industry faces significant challenges in queue management, particularly during peak hours when customer volume exceeds seating capacity. Traditional approaches to managing waiting customers are fraught with inefficiencies:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Manual Record Keeping:</strong> Staff members maintain handwritten lists or use basic spreadsheets, leading to errors, lost records, and difficulty in tracking customer status</li>
    <li><strong>Inaccurate Wait Time Estimates:</strong> Without data-driven insights, staff provide rough estimates based on intuition, often resulting in under or overestimation</li>
    <li><strong>Poor Customer Communication:</strong> Customers have no visibility into their queue position or realistic wait times, leading to frustration and abandonment</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Data Analytics:</strong> Restaurants cannot analyze queue patterns, identify peak hours, or make data-driven decisions to optimize operations</li>
    <li><strong>Inefficient Resource Allocation:</strong> Without insights into queue dynamics, restaurants struggle to allocate staff and resources effectively</li>
</ul>

<p>Research in restaurant operations management has shown that queue management significantly impacts customer satisfaction, retention rates, and overall revenue. According to industry studies, up to 30% of customers will leave if wait times exceed their expectations, and inaccurate wait time estimates are a primary cause of negative reviews and customer dissatisfaction.</p>

<h2>2.2 Specific Problem</h2>

<p>This project specifically addresses the following problems in restaurant queue management:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Lack of Automation:</strong> Manual queue management is time-consuming, error-prone, and takes staff time away from customer service</li>
    <li><strong>Inaccurate Wait Time Predictions:</strong> Simple calculations based on queue length fail to account for party size variations, time of day, service efficiency, and other critical factors</li>
    <li><strong>No Real-Time Visibility:</strong> Both staff and customers lack real-time access to queue status and position updates</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Analytics:</strong> Restaurants cannot track historical data, identify trends, or measure queue efficiency without a centralized system</li>
    <li><strong>Poor Queue Type Differentiation:</strong> Mixing dine-in and takeaway customers in a single queue leads to confusion and suboptimal service</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Frustration:</strong> Uncertainty about wait times and lack of transparency in the queuing process creates negative customer experiences</li>
</ol>

<h2>2.3 Disadvantages and Cons of the Problem</h2>

<p>The existing problems in restaurant queue management result in several significant disadvantages:</p>

<h3>Operational Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Staff Time Waste:</strong> Employees spend excessive time on manual queue tracking instead of customer service</li>
    <li><strong>Error Accumulation:</strong> Handwritten records lead to mistakes in customer information, queue numbers, and party sizes</li>
    <li><strong>Inefficient Table Turnover:</strong> Poor queue visibility leads to delays in seating customers when tables become available</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Misallocation:</strong> Without data on peak hours and queue patterns, staff scheduling is suboptimal</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer Experience Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High Abandonment Rates:</strong> Customers leave when wait times are unclear or exceed expectations</li>
    <li><strong>Negative Reviews:</strong> Poor queue management directly correlates with negative online reviews and ratings</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Frustration:</strong> Lack of transparency and inaccurate estimates create frustration and dissatisfaction</li>
    <li><strong>Lost Loyalty:</strong> Poor experiences reduce customer retention and repeat visits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Business Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue Loss:</strong> Customer abandonment during peak hours directly reduces revenue</li>
    <li><strong>Competitive Disadvantage:</strong> Restaurants with better queue management attract more customers</li>
    <li><strong>Missed Optimization Opportunities:</strong> Without analytics, restaurants cannot identify and address inefficiencies</li>
    <li><strong>Increased Operational Costs:</strong> Inefficient processes require more staff time and resources</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>5.3 Challenges Encountered and Solutions</h2>

<h3>Challenge 1: AI Prediction Accuracy</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue:</strong> Initial predictions were too generic, not accounting for time-of-day variations</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Enhanced context preparation to include peak hour detection, current queue composition, and historical patterns</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Improved prediction accuracy and user confidence in estimates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge 2: Real-Time Updates</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue:</strong> WebSocket implementation proved complex for initial development</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented JavaScript polling mechanism with 30-second intervals</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Simpler implementation providing adequate real-time feel, WebSocket planned for future</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge 3: Queue Number Generation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue:</strong> Needed unique, sequential numbers that reset daily but handle concurrent requests</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Prefix-based system (T for Table, K for Kitchen) with database-driven increment logic</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Reliable unique number generation without race conditions</li>
</ul>
